Multidisciplinary graphic designer, French/Indonesian, based in Rotterdam (NL). His approach to the use of typography tends to be quite illustrative and encourages the creation of clumsy, organic compositions. He has a keen interest in building custom tools/parameters to explode from and play with, obtaining unexpected outcomes.
